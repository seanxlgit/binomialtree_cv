## Welcome to Sean's Binomial Tree Changing Volatility Page

This code implements binomial tree option pricing with changing volatility.

## the pros of this code are:

- handles changing volatility instead of using unrealistic constant volatility assumption
- calculates option price more accurately with setting up a **changing volatility** profile
